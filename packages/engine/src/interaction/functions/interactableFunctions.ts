  TODO split camera frustum culling of xrUI show/hide into its own process.
  each input source should have its own distance sorted list of interactables
  each pointer should have a raycaster that will update the selected interactable per input source if relevant  
  
  TODO remove the radius check, replace with a managed separate entity with a collider set to the interactable layer, give that an input component, rather than proximity
  can then remove the need to do sorting in interactable system vs just the sorted raycast in inputsystem 
  
  KEEP THE TOGGLE FOR CLICKABLE - or rename it. We probably want an option to use a built-in collider vs a generated spherical one
  
  TODO make inputSourceEntity required. Use the raycaster, but move it to the inputPointerComponent raycaster
   leave ray on inputSourceComponent, inputPointerComponent will update the ray via the raycaster
   (when in webxr the ray will be updated directly from the xr controller)
  
  TODO see if ClientInputSystem line 160 is the proper way to do the raycaster/ray updating.
  
  TODO add distance heuristic to input component
  
  TODO will need to split out camera frustum culling from this available
  
  TODO each input source will manage its own set of available interactables (by proximity and ray), and the currently selected one
   maybe have a tag per inputsource instead of having an array in the inputsource
   
  TODO also see if we're going to need an array of available arrays, or one per inputsource?
   currently makes no sense to be sorting a single array if we might have multiple input sources/pointers
